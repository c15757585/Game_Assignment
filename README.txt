# Game_Assignment

A game for a DT508 assignment for Bryan Duggan
Created by Philip Elliott

Genre: Board Game
Name: Connect 4 from scratch

Description: I wanted to make a game that I might load up and play against colleagues and so on, I set the task of making it as compact as possible while adding as much to it as I can. 
The Game: The game is based off of the idea of the classic connect four, you have to line up four tokens in a row in any direction to win the game. I hope its as easy to code as it is easy to write. I might add mouse click sounds and some animations to help improve the feel of the sketch.
